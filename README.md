Multi-documents Non-factoid Question Answering Dataset.

This repository presents a dataset containing exclusively non-factoid questions for multi-document QA. The data set should contain for each question the relevant documents, the relevant information span in each document, and a correct answer.

For a question to be considered for the dataset, it should be non-factoid and complex enough to be multi-documents.
Also, the question should be considered of the types *definition*, *casual*, or *procedural*. Each question contains at least two relevant documents that should be considered to the QA model to provide a relevant, complete and precise answer.

* Question
* Answer
* Multiple relevant documents.
  * Relevant span of text for the answer.
